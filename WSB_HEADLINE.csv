"Food stamps stopped because of shutdown.  People so squeezed by rising prices they're relying on MCD Monopoly to survive.


>With a government shutdown that's left people without pay, ceased SNAP benefits, and the rising cost of groceries in general, Americans are having a tough time. One way that some people are coping with this hardship is McDonald's and its Monopoly promotion, where customers can redeem codes in the app in exchange for food and prizes. The problem is, people are desperate enough right now that they're willing to do anything to exploit the promotional game, and it's driving both customers and workers alike to the brink.

>""u just fed me and my bf living in our car thank u,"" reads one top reply on the video, which calls app redemption the ""free-to-play"" version of McDonald's Monopoly.

>""Being able to eat something while having no money is so..rare,"" reads one [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonalds/comments/1oibl74/im_not_gonna_lie_this_monopoly_sht_has_been_a/), which calls the Monopoly game a lifesaver. ""I've been dead broke for the past month, and while I do have a job, I won't get paid for another week.""


But yea AI and NVDA is fucking amazing right tech bros?  We're so blessed that it's delivering on all its promises and hype totally.  Oh I see, you need another 2% rate cut and government contracts for supercomputers, another 10x in stock price then we'll see the benefit.

>If there's one undercurrent to many posts discussing McDonald's Monopoly, it's exasperation. People are dumpster diving for the Monopoly pieces, going through the trash inside the store.

>Since some people are relying on McDonald's Monopoly exploits to avoid starving, the dwindling stock of codes has left customers confused and frustrated.

>""Honestly fed up with McDonalds Monopoly,"" reads one X post where the user claims that they've ordered multiple times without receiving any pieces.

>""I've been to three different McDonalds, and there's no Monopoly pieces,"" one annoyed customer reports on TikTok.

"Chase will be on tomorrow; gangbuster beats and AMZN has a lot of room to run with AWS firing on all cylinders again.

AMZN feels cheap compared to the rest of the megacaps.  Huge and growing backlog for AWS to keep growing at this kind of 18-22% rate.

""Only"" $2.5 trillion market cap on what is the biggest business in the world (AWS + their marketplace); easy path to $3-3.5 trillion as people see its valuation lagging the rest of the megacaps.

Would be a shock if AMZN isn't at $280-300 over the next few months.  Just like GOOGL caught up the past few months, AMZN is the next runner for tech.",1

AAPL up 2% on iPhone sales miss. Thankfully I only bought one put FD. These earnings reports don’t make a lot of sense at times. I remember earlier this year I went long on QCOM. Had a solid quarter nothing bad about it and the stock fell 8% it proceeded to go up 10-15% the following week after its report. I have no idea how algos price these things,1

"$DOCN Moonshot



Listen up you degenerates.  $DOCN is about to fire off like a Musk rocket to the moon. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/nQsfc7B9Cw

Perfect Degen Diligence above, just wrong timing….   ER is next week!  Look at the past few earnings reports and you’ll see why this is a no brainer.  

Q2 ER launched the stonk from $27 to $35, a measly 35% overnight.  

Both AMZN and GOOG just ripped off earnings and reporting cloud computing as large.  Guess what DOCN specializes in, good job Sherlock.  

Time to band together and retrieve the bag holders from the previous mistimed degen diligence (although we’ll put together) and ride this ocean into the sunset!
